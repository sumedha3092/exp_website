			<p>Our ethos is always to deliver inspirational interiors for the way the client wants to live. Understanding and interpreting our clients' aesthetic and lifestyle needs is an essential part of our skill set, in order that the design reflects their personality and responds to their individual lifestyle, tastes and aspirations. We pride ourselves on designing practical solutions for whatever the project requires.</p>

			<p>Each project is designed with close attention to detail, managed and implemented with great care. We work with craftsmen and bespoke furniture makers as required, to create seamless, well executed and beautifully finished projects, delivered on time and on budget.</p>

			<p>Working primarily in and around London and the Home Counties, on schemes that range from small intimate spaces to large renovation and refurbishment projects. We work closely with our trusted professional team including planning consultant, architect, engineers and contractors.</p>

			<p>Our design skills encompass interior design and space planning through to creating bespoke furnishings, joinery and lighting design schemes. We can source unusual accessories, vintage and salvaged pieces as well as artwork for residential and commercial projects.</p>

			<p>We also visit the main trade shows including London, Milan and Paris in order to be able to offer our clients the best in what is new, exquisite or vintage.</p>
